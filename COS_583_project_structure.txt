COS 583 Project Structure


main application gui....
	enables:	choosing input data set 
	visualizes: 	data set in batches, input and output.
	enables: 	changing/setting hyper parameters and network shape
	visualizes:    view of network
	enables: 	training of network
	visualizes:	visualizing backdrop.
	visualizes: 	choosing different functions


There modes then
Input network training and viz


class neural network
	constructor takes layers list and function…

	can learn and train to some error? or for some iterations….
	can run iteration
	can return immutable model that returns output for some input
	can be fed training data
	can return model that you can show bprop on...
	might need to return errors per layer to show layer by layer backdrop


Interface function. sigmoid…..


Visual net? network particularly for backprop?

Update notes with slide info.

helper objects like layer??
helper for maybe testing????

mike nielsen website in bookmark very helpful
python code too.

Java swing.

java to json for visualization…

so add code maybe in dialog or whatever to build network…. change data information to training information, ability to learn input, percentage, viz from son fie

test for errors
add tooltips


push neural net project to git

check for mismatch between nn and input data




Presentation…..

Show that neural net can learn and help others learn b comparing iteration etc…

characteristics:…
underlying network package distinct from application, 
another app can use the package for all this, decoupled.

many features can be tuned and can see effect on accuracy and user provided input

can incrementally train a network 


example; 

TestDigit params….. layers: 784, 30, 10
epochs = 25. eta = 3.0 mbsize 20

Half Adder layers: 2 4 4 2
epochs = 3000. eta = 10. mbsize 4

Implication  layers: 2 4 4 2 / 1
epochs: 2500. eta = 10 mbsize 4s

Sine: relu vs sigmoid?
2 4 4 2 
epochs: 2000. eta = 5 mbsize = 400


future work…..
more functions
multiple networks side by side
visualization, at least showing steps of backdrop…. 

challenges…
